        /// but never destroys the ones we don't need, only deactivates them in case we need them later.
        /// However, unlike Pool and Pool Manager scripts, it is meant for UI, which has a tendency to show a given
        /// number N of widgets on a Horizontal/Vertical Layout or a Grid, always in an ordered manner.
        /// This is very different from pooling objects in an unordered set because their position is determined by
        /// their transform, so their order in the Scene Hierarchy doesn't matter.
        /// Note that the caller still needs to initialise the widget's content itself after the call,
        /// as this function is unaware of the specific component types on widgetPrefab, nor their initialisation methods.

        /// of them to avoid cluttering the scene, and because we cannot visualize them all due to the paging system
