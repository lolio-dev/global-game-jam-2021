# UnityConstants

I extracted the UnityConstants folder from the archived [UnityToolbag repository](https://github.com/nickgravelyn/UnityToolbag) by Nick Gravelyn (removing the Editor folder since this repository should always be cloned into an Editor folder). It is described as follows in the original README:

- [UnityConstants](UnityConstants) - Tool for generating a C# script containing the names and values for tags, layers, sorting layers, and scenes.

The LICENSE in this folder takes precedence over any LICENSE in the upper hierarchy.
